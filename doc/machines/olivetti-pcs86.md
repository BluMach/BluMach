# Olivetti PCS 86

Status as of 2026-08-27: boots Olivetti MS-DOS 3.30a and passes the currently
exercised Resident Diagnostics 1.09 tests. Some motherboard glue, PS/2 timing,
serial I/O and host-visible video behaviour remain incomplete.

See also the [Olivetti PCS family overview](olivetti-pcs-family.md).

## Recommended BluMach configuration

- machine: `[8086] Olivetti PCS86` (`olivetti_pcs86`);
- CPU: NEC V30 at 8 MHz;
- conventional memory: 640 KiB;
- video: onboard Paradise-compatible implementation;
- floppy: one internal 3.5-inch 1.44 MB drive;
- hard disk: internal XTA when an original-style disk is required;
- optional onboard EMS: none, 384 KiB or 1,920 KiB.

The EMS choices represent no SIMMs, two 256 KiB SIMMs or two 1 MiB SIMMs.
After the first 640 KiB address space is satisfied, the remaining expansion is
presented through four 16 KiB page frames.

## Documented hardware

The PCS 86 is an XT-class design built around an NEC V30 at 8 MHz, but includes
features unusual for a conventional XT: onboard VGA-class video, a 1.44 MB
floppy controller, an integrated XTA fixed-disk interface, two interchangeable
PS/2-style ports and an MM58167 real-time clock.

The current implementation exposes the documented board-control registers,
PS/2 ports at `66h-6Ah`, RTC at `E0h-EFh`, control registers at `B0h-B7h`, XTA
enable control and the onboard EMS windows. Several undocumented latch bits are
still conservative placeholders.

## Firmware

Resident Diagnostics and system BIOS identify as revision 1.09, dated
1989-11-17. Two 32 KiB EPROM captures form one 64 KiB image:

| Required runtime file | Role |
|---|---|
| `roms/machines/olivetti_pcs86/CSAB05_02-17.BIN` | even bytes |
| `roms/machines/olivetti_pcs86/CSAB04_02-25.BIN` | odd bytes |

BluMach interleaves them at `F0000-FFFFF`. The resulting checksum is zero and
the reset vector is `EA 5B E0 00 F0`. System, resident-diagnostic, video and
fixed-disk firmware coexist in this ROM; do not add unrelated video or disk
option ROMs for a factory configuration.

## Storage and boot media

The integrated fixed-disk path is XTA, not ordinary 16-bit IDE. The preserved
working geometry for a Conner CP3026 is 615 cylinders, 4 heads and 17 sectors,
approximately 20 MiB. A generated blank image proves geometry handling but is
not an original disk dump.

Olivetti MS-DOS 3.30a Rev. 1.03 boots from the 1.44 MB floppy drive and is used
for validation. Its presence in the preservation library does not prove that
the particular capture came from the three-disk PCS 86 retail package.

## Validated behaviour

- BIOS checksum and cold POST;
- NEC V30, ROM, DMA, PIC and timer diagnostics;
- 640 KiB conventional memory;
- RTC and basic keyboard operation;
- floppy sector reads, IRQ6 and MS-DOS 3.30a boot;
- onboard EMS with 1,920 KiB fitted;
- XTA controller detection.

## Known limitations and next tests

- A host capture may remain black even when VGA text memory contains the full
  diagnostic or DOS screen; visible framebuffer presentation needs retesting.
- PS/2 electrical timing, mouse behaviour and the full keyboard command set are
  not certified.
- The original DOS EMS driver and INT 67h interface have not been recovered.
- The integrated serial port and several enable bits at port `65h` are partial.
- Installation and repeated boot from an XTA disk require a clean current test.
- Machine-private state should be released when switching models in one session.

## Optional sound upgrades (2026-09-29)

The creator offers AdLib, Creative CMS/Game Blaster and Sound Blaster
1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 as **experimental user upgrades**, never factory options.
It selects one card and leaves the default at no sound card. All five reuse
existing ISA 8-bit models without additional firmware. XT/V30-compatible DOS
applications are required; a newer driver package is not automatically suitable.

Creative's [SB1/2 specifications](https://www.vogonsdrivers.com/getfile.php?fileid=383&menustate=0)
identify CT1320/CT1350 and PC/XT ISA compatibility. The CMS path is a compatible
inference from its existing ISA model and contemporary PC software, not a PCS
hardware test. SB Pro is excluded because its
[Getting Started guide](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/4347851/Creative-Sound-Blaster-Pro.html?page=4)
specifies a 286 or later. ISA 16-bit cards are not offered.

Bus/device/configuration contracts are tested, not guest audio. DMA, IRQ,
FM/PCM playback and the exact driver/application versions still need validation.
Other obscure ISA 8-bit cards remain outside this reviewed allowlist.
